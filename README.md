Hey, I'm Daniel. I'm a full-stack software engineer with experience architecting, building, and maintaining systems that support a variety of different business needs at enterprise scale.

I thrive in environments using leading-edge technologies, and always have a number of projects of my own in progress at home. I enjoy discussing technology with colleagues and friends.
